# warren_folder

Hi!
Purpose of making this project is to make my worklife a bit more organised. 
Currently I'm working in conference centre and
One of my duties is to control state of the building from guests point of view. 
Another reason is, what I really hope and what is my real goal of doing this project, 
To open the gate for my first Junior developer job. 

This is my first project. I've practiced with two tutorial earlier:
1. DjangoGirls
2. HelloWebApp

I'll try to develop this project as deep as my knowledge let me. Please feel free to make any suggestions. Thank you:)
