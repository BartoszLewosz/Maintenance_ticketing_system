## Description

This is my first live **Web Application**. I use it on daily basis to keep the record of issues at my current workplace. All of 60 employees can report technical problem, that occured. There are four sections:
- Garden
- Maintenance
- Electric
- Plumbing

Each section stores specific problems. If you are not sure which section your problem belongs, please add to *Maintenance*


### What's behind?

To create this simple app I used:

**Backend:**
- Python, Django
- function-based views
- SQLite3 database
- pythonanywhere.com as a web hosting service
- GIT 

**Frontend:**
- Basic HTML & CSS 
- bootstrap 4 adjusted with stylesheet
